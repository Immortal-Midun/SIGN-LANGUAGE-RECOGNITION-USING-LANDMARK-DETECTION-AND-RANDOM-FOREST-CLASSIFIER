# SIGN-LANGUAGE-RECOGNITION-USING-LANDMARK-DETECTION-AND-RANDOM-FOREST-CLASSIFIER
This project detects hand landmarks and uses them to recognize sign language gestures. I collected landmark data, processed it into features, and trained a Random Forest Classifier to identify different signs. It can be used for basic gesture recognition and can be expanded for more signs.
